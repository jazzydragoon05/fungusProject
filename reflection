Learning fungus was certainly interesting, because I had never worked on something like this before! It's new, exciting, and something I've wanted to do for awhile, with my emphasis on writing and narrative. 
To begin, I had a bit of a hard time finding the large megafolder with all of the elements and things that made up fungus, because it wasn't shown on the unity asset store anymore. I was dismayed, but wanted to keep trying.
Eventually I found it, and had Unity up and running with it. It was a little rough, tyring to figure out how this thing worked and how to make a game out of it, but the more I played around with it, the better I got.
One thing that was challenging about the development process was certainly the github and trying to get all the files on there. It was a massive effort because I was unskilled, but with the help of a friend everything worked.
An element that stands out to me is the option to pick and choose dialogue options, and how those choices lead down to different paths. Very interesting, this element would be something I do more with!
